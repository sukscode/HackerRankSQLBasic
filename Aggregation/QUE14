We define an employees total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2  space-separated integers.

employee_id  INTEGER
name         STRING
MONTHS       INTEGER
SALARY       INTEGER

SELECT MAX(SALARY*MONTHS) AS TOT, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE MONTHS*SALARY = (SELECT MAX(MONTHS*SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE)) FROM EMPLOYEE;
