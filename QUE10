Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

FIELD       TYPE
ID          NUMBER
CITY        VARCHAR2
STATE       VARCHAR2
LAT_N       NUMBER
LONG_W      NUMBER


(SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) AS LENI FROM STATION ORDER BY LENI,CITY LIMIT 1) UNION (SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) AS LENI FROM STATION ORDER BY LENI DESC,CITY LIMIT 1);
